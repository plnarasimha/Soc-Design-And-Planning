# Introduction to OpenLANE
OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. It also provides a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII. Currently, it supports both A and B variants of the sky130 PDK, the C variant of the gf180mcu PDK, and instructions to add support for other (including proprietary) PDKs are documented. The whole documentation can be found here [https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane]. OpenLane abstracts the underlying open source utilities, and allows users to configure all their behavior with just a single configuration file.
